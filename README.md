# Github-Recommender-System
## Introduction
In this work, we used implicit ratings and an auto-encoder with a modified cost function to make a GitHub Recommender System. 

Here we collected the data and constructed the confidence and prediction matrices based on implicit rating schemes. This data was then used to train an auto-encoder with a modified cost function and test the trained model using recall metric.
